---

* **Inverters:** Smart single/three-phase, DC→AC, remote monitoring \+ safety features.

* **Maintenance:** **5 years free** (checks, support; cleaning support available; AMC after).

---

## **3\) Customer Journey (Use this structure in all “How it works” writeups)**

1. **Free Home Visit & Documentation** – rooftop inspection, electricity bill review, docs collected.

2. **Quick & Hassle-Free Installation** – design, panels/inverter/wiring & safety setup.

3. **Subsidy & System Activation** – Mierae manages approvals, files subsidy, activates system & net meter.

**Standard CTAs:** “Book a free home inspection,” “Compare EMI vs one-time payment,” “Fast-track your subsidy & installation.”

---

## **4\) Financing & Subsidy (Plain-English Explainers for Blogs)**

* **EMI options:** Zero-upfront EMI plans up to **120 months**; *EMI often ≤ current electricity bill*. Prepayment allowed. (Don’t quote bank names unless provided in brief.)

* **Subsidy (residential):** *Up to ₹78,000* under **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana** for \~3kW+ residential systems; **Mierae handles paperwork** and DISCOM coordination. (Keep scheme name; avoid over-promising—“eligibility governed by current govt. norms.”)

* **Payback:** Typical **3–5 years** (post-subsidy \+ savings).

* **Savings framing (canonical):** After a right-sized rooftop system, typical residual bill **₹0–₹500/month** for many homes, depending on usage, season, and DISCOM policies. (Use this instead of any conflicting example.)

---

## **5\) Solar Savings Calculator (for consistent content & examples)**

**Inputs:** monthly bill (₹), state/city.  
 **Assumptions (baseline, can be tuned per state):** tariff ₹6/kWh, 5 sun-hours/day, 100 sqft/kW.  
 **Formulas:**

* monthly\_kWh \= bill\_inr / 6

* required\_kW \= monthly\_kWh / (30 × 5\)

* area\_sqft \= required\_kW × 100  
   **Worked example** (to reuse in blogs): bill ₹3,000 in *Anakapalle, AP* → \~**500 kWh/month**, raw size \~**3.33 kW**, recommend **4 kW**, area \~**400 sqft**. Always caveat “final size after on-site inspection.”

**On-site vs calculator:** Calculator \= instant estimate; **free inspection** \= accurate design. Use both in content.

---

## **6\) Policies (short snippets a writer can drop into posts/landing sections)**

* **Refunds:** Request within **7 days** of payment. **No refund** after loan initiation or once installation/services have started.

* **Warranty coverage:** Panels **12y product/25y performance**, inverter **5–10y** (brand). Manufacturing defects & functioning covered; Ts\&Cs apply.
